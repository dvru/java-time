Carpet Cost Calculator
    The Carpet Company has asked you to write an application that calculates the price of carpeting for rectangular rooms.
    To calculate the price, you multiply the area of the floor (width times length) by the price per square meter of carpet.
    For example, the area of the floor that is 12 meters long and 10 meters wide is 120 square meters.
    To cover the floor with a carpet that costs $8 per square meter would cost $960.

Complex Operations
    A complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i is a solution of the equation x2 = −1.
    Because no real number satisfies this equation, i is called an imaginary number. For the complex number a + bi, a is called the real part, and b is called the imaginary part.
    To add or subtract two complex numbers, just add or subtract the corresponding real and imaginary parts.
    For instance, the sum of 5 + 3i and 4 + 2i is 9 + 5i. For another, the sum of 3 + i and –1 + 2i is 2 + 3i.
