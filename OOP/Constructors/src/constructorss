OOP & CONSTRUCTORS

Challenge 1

    Account & Main
        Create a new class for a bank account
        Create fields for the account number, balance, customer name, email and phone number.
        Create getters and setters for each field
        Create two additional methods
        1. To allow the customer to deposit funds (this should increment the balance field).
        2. To allow the customer to withdraw funds. This should deduct from the balance field,
        but not allow the withdrawal to complete if their are insufficient funds.
        You will want to create various code in the Main class (the one created by IntelliJ) to
        confirm your code is working.
        Add some System.out.println's in the two methods above as well.

Challenge 2

    VIP Person
          Create a new class VipCustomer
          it should have 3 fields name, credit limit, and email address.
          create 3 constructors
          1st constructor empty should call the constructor with 3 parameters with default values
          2nd constructor should pass on the 2 values it receives and add a default value for the 3rd
          3rd constructor should save all fields.
          create getters only for this using code generation of intellij as setters wont be needed
          test and confirm it works.
