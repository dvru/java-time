If then Else Recap
    The if statement identifies which statement or code block to run based on the value of an expression.
    In other words based on a specific condition.

    Inside the code block defined by curly braces
    {and} we can have one or more multiple statements

    We can use the else statement after the if, in that case when the condition is false the else block
    will be executed
    We can also add else if to test multiple conditions

    if(condition) {
        //if statement
        execute line ( code block)
    } else {
        // else statement
        execute line ( code block)
    }
