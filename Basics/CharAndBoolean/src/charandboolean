        Its not just a single byte is that it allows you to store Unicode characters.

// Unicode
    UniCode is an international encoding standard for use with different languages and scripts,
    by which each letter, digit, or symbol is assigned a unique numeric value that applies across
    different platforms and programs

    the entire English alpha. But other lang need more char, and often a lot more.

    Unicode allows up to represent these lang and the way it works is that by using
    a combination of two bytes and that a char takes up in memory it can represent
    and one of 65535 different types of characters
