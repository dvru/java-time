//
//    Write a class with the name Rectangle.
//        The class needs two fields (instance variable) with name width and length both of type double.
//        The class needs to have one constructor with parameters width and length both of type double and it needs to initialize the fields.
//        In case the width parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the width field value to 0.
//        In case the length parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the length field value to 0.

//        Write the following methods (instance methods):
//        Method named getWidth without any parameters, it needs to return the value of width field.
//        Method named getLength without any parameters, it needs to return the value of length field.
//        Method named getArea without any parameters, it needs to return the calculated area (width * length).
