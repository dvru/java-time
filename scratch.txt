In Java primitive types are the most basic types, The Int is one of eight.
The eight types are: boolean, byte, char, short, int, long, float and double.
Consider these types as building blocks of data manipulation.

MIN_VALUE AND MAX_VALUE, tell us min and max ranges of nums that can be stored.

A Byte occupies 8 bits, Byte has a width of 8
A short can store large range of nums and occupies 16 bits, width of 16
An int, has a much larger range, occupies 32 bits, width of 32

Int needs four times the amount of space, than a byte.
