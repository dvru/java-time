this vs super

super
    used to access/call the parent class members
    (variables and methods)
    - Used with method overriding
this
    used to call the current class members (variables and methods)
    This is required when we have a parameter with the same
    name as an instance variable(field)
    - Used with constructors and setters, optional getter.

static
    cant use the "this" keyword
    A method that does have use variable instances, should be declared static

Method Overloading
    means providing two or more separate methods in a class
    with the same name but different params
Method return
    allows us to reuse the same method name
Overloading
    reduces duplicating code, so don't have to remember method nam
