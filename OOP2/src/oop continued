OOP - Object Oriented Programming

Inheritance
    - "is a" relationship between classes, where one class extends information from another,
    - For ex. Car and a Vehicle, a Car extends from Vehicle, meaning a Car is a Vehicle

Composition
    - "has a" relationship between classes,
    - For ex. PC has a Motherboard, a Monitor, and Case
    - Those classes also have other classes, Monitor "has a" resolution, Case "has a" Dimensions
    - PC then holds everything composed together, and a Motherboard, a Monitor, and Case

Encapsulation

Polymorphism
