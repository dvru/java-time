Control Flow Statements

Switch
    good to use when testing the same variable,
    test different values for that variable

For Loop
    for(init; condition; increment) {
    // statements
    }
    semi colons are required;
    increment known as the iterator or iteration step
    curly braces to define loop code block (body)

while and do while break
    do {           <-- Curly braces to define loop code block (body)
        //statement
    }   while (condition);  <---semi colon required

    The while loop checks the condition at the start before executing the block.
    With the do while loop the code block is executed at least once and then the condition is checked
    Be careful with conditions, it is easy to end up with endless loop, a loop that never end or to end
        with a loop that never executes
    Tip: always check your conditions/expressions
    You can interrupt the loop with continue and break
        continue: will bypass the park of the code block that is below the continue keyword
        break: will exit the loop depending on the condition that we are checking
