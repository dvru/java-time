    Operators in Java are special symbols that perform specific operations on one, two or three operands,
    and then return a result. ex. +

Operand
    Used to describe any object that is manipulated by an operator
        int myVar = 15 + 12;
        + is the operator
        15, 12 are the operands

Expression
    formed by combining variables, literals, method return value
    int myVar = 15 + 12;
    15 + 12 is the expression which returns 27

    if (expression) {
        // put one or more statements here
    }
