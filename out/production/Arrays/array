Array
    - An array is a data structure that allows us to store multiple values of the same type into a
    single variable. The default values of a numeric array elements are set to zero
    arrays are zero indexed, so an array with n elements is indexed from 0 to n take 1.
        - So for example 10 elements the index range would be from 0 through 9.
        Now if we try to access an index that is out of range
    - Java will give us an array index out of bounds exception that which indicates
    that the index is out of range in other words, out of bounds we're trying to
    access an element that is outside of what we've defined. To access array elements,
    we use square braces this is also known as the array access operator.
